Struts MVC:
Web->ControllerFilterDispatcher --> Model Action --> View result

client->Interceptors->Struts XML

Action class
JSP

1) Interceptor
Every action has its own stack of interceptors.
They are invoked befor and after action (before action and after result)
separate and reuse these crosscutting concerns ????

2) ValueStack
it is simply a storage area that holds all of the application domain data
associated with the processing of a request.
Data is moved to the ValueStack in preparation of request processing, it is manipulated there during action execution.
And it is read from there when the results render their response pages.
It slices through the whole length of the framework 
because it is stored in ThreadLocal context called the ActionContext.
You can call ValueStack in Interception, Action or result

ActionContext ctx = null;
   ctx.getValueStack()

3) OGNL is expression language that allows you to reference and manupilate the data on the ValueStack.
Usually you do not touch ActionContext(ValueStack) directly, but with help of OGNL.

Chapter 2
2.1) Auto Configuration (by default Struts 2 looks for URLs ending with .action .do - for struts1)
2.2) Declaring application's architecture.
You can make configurations in xml or Java annotations.
Typically, you only need to implement actions and wire them to built-in results and interceptors.
2.3) Decalring with XML or Annotations
<action name="Login" class="manning.Login">
 <result>/AccountPage.jsp</result>
 <result name="input">/Login.jsp</result>
 </action>

 <action name="Registration" >
 <result>/Registration.jsp</result>
 </action>
 <action name="Register" class="manning.Register">
 <result>/RegistrationSuccess.jsp</result>
 <result name="input">/Registration.jsp</result>
 </action>
 
 @Results({
 @Result(name="input", value="/RegistrationSuccess.jsp" )
 @Result(value="/RegistrationSuccess.jsp" )
 })
 public class Login {

 public string execute() {

it has same 
String execute()
+
additioonal methods like validate()
