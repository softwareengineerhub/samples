Virtualization in JasperReports
Virtualization in JasperReports is a mechanism to handle very large reports efficiently by not keeping the entire report in memory at once.

Think of it as lazy loading / on-demand report generation.
🔹 Why virtualization is needed
By default, JasperReports stores the entire filled report in memory (JasperPrint).
For small reports, this is fine.
For large reports (100,000+ rows), this can cause OutOfMemoryError.

Virtualization solves this by:
Keeping only a portion of the report in memory
Writing the rest to temporary disk storage
Allowing exporting large reports to PDF/Excel without crashing JVM
