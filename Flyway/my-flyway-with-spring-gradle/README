./gradlew -Pflyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5440/mydb


./gradlew flywayMigrate
./gradlew flywayInfo
 In case you want to override flyway configuration (for example url)
./gradlew -Pflyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5440/mydb flywayMigrate

Also you can run flyway from IntellijIDEA --> Gradle --> Tasks --> flyway --> flywayInfo
