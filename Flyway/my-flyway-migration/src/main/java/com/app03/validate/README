VALIDATE:
mvn flyway:validate
checks with help of checksums available migrations vs applied
Provides failed validation if we have some scripts that were not applied yet.

 For example:
 ValidateOutput:
 		version=5
 		description=Insert third into person table
 		filepath=/Users/denis/IdeaProjects/my-flyway-migration/target/classes/db/migration/V5__Insert_third_into_person_table.sql
 		errorDetails=RESOLVED_VERSIONED_MIGRATION_NOT_APPLIED; Detected resolved migration not applied to database: 5.
 To fix this error, either run migrate, or set -ignorePendingMigrations=true.
