1) To have instance of Inner class we must:
    a) in case we use it inside our class
    MyInner myInner = new MyInner();

    b) outside:
    MyClass class = new MyClass();
    class.new MyInner();
    or
    MyClass.MyInner inner = new MyClass(). new MyInner();

2) In case we want to have static inner class--> we do not need instance of Outer class
    MyClass.MyInner inner = new MyClass.MyInner();

3) We can define InnerClass inside method.
We can use global variables inside,
but we can not use method variables (only allowed in case they are final)
inner classes inside methods could be final/abstract
In case method is static --> InnerClass can use only static fields and methods of OuterClass

4) MyOuter.this - gives reference to instance of OuterClass


5) inner class might be private
