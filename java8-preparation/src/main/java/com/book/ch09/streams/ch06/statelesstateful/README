Stateful operations req context
for exampleL stream.limit()


Make sure your reductions are associative and stateless.
Avoid side effects.
Make sure your pipeline is stateless by avoiding contextual operations
such as limit(), skip(), distinct(), and sorted().


reductions are associative:
f(a+b+c)!=f(a)+f(b)+f(c)
for example square


(A operator B) operator C = A operator (B operator C)
