1) Associative Operations
The point is, just as with sequential stream reductions, parallel stream
reductions need to be associative. This is even more important for parallel
streams given that we don’t know how the system will split up and then
recombine the stream results.

2) Stateless Operations (and Streams)
A stateless operation in a stream pipeline is an operation that does not depend
on the context in which it’s operating. Before we talk more about what
stateless operations are, let’s talk about what they are not.
There are two main ways you can create a stateful stream pipeline. The
first is with side effects

side effects
occur when your result creates or depends on changes to state in the pipeline

for example filter stream and count numbers%10;
in parallel stream it will tend to errors. (or you need to create synch block)
