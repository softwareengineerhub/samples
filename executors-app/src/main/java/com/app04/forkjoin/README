1) On the 1 hand it is same as ExecutorPool

But tasks can produce subtasks (fork-join)

TaskA
  SubA1   SubA2  SubA3
result

Each sub task might be calculated on separate core.
So, all sub-tasks might be running in ||

Then all results add/aggregated/joined to result


2) ForJoinPool has concept of work stealing and per thread queueing
When we call fork (create sub-task) - new task is created not for ALL THREADS POOL,
but task is added to personal Dequeue for Thread

Work stealing:
Suppose we have 2 Threads
T1 - produces many tasks
T2 - already completed its jobs
So, T2 can help T1 and take some task from dequeue of T2


3) To start task you migh call:
From Executor
3.1) execute(Runnable)
3.2) submit(Runnable)
3.3) submit(Callable)
From ForkJoin:
3.4) execute(ForkJoinTask) - arrange asynch execution
3.4) invoke(ForkJoinTask) - awaits and returns result (blocking)
3.4) submit(ForkJoinTask) - returns Future
